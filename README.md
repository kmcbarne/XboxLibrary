This is a Windows application for creating a catalog of games owned by the user for Microsoft's Xbox platform.  The genesis for this project came as a result of the difficulty in being able to easily access a list of games purchase digitally through the Xbox store, coupled with the tendency for there to be multiple versions of the same game listed in the store.  As a result, it's relatively easy to accidentally purchase multiple copies of the same game, either on different consoles, or because a different version was released by the publisher (GOTY editions, rereleases, etc).  This app provides an easy way to maintain an independent listing of games owned, either digital or physical copies, as well as including the ability to track completion, progress, etc.
